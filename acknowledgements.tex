\noindent
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor \supname{} for all his help and guidance throughout the work on this thesis, and also throughout my studies.

I also thank the teachers of my doctoral courses, especially prof. RNDr. Ivo Marek, DrSc., rest his soul, for his advice on the mathematical problems that arose during my research work. I am grateful for the discussions with prof. Dr. Ing. Bo\v{r}ek Patz\'ak about the design of the database for the finite element model, which was an inspiration for a part of my research. My special thanks go to Ing. Martin Hor\'ak, Ph.D., who brought me to the idea to use singular value decomposition for the compression of FEM results. Many thanks also to the colleagues in the Department of Mechanics for a great time spent after the working hours.

I would also like to give my thanks to my parents for their patience and understanding. Last but not the least, I thank Hana for her endless support and encouragement that helped me to accomplish the goal.\\
